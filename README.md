# Relation-extraction-using-Semantic-Web
We will process unstructured data from web (obtained by crawling some sample websites) by having a Apache SolR installed locally and manually feeding it web pages.  We can use Stanford NLP API to extract semantics from the unstructured text. After we extract some semantics, we can construct a structured data format, probably RDF/XML/OWL and also have a visual representation of the graph data using Gruff.
